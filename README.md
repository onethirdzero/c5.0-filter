# C5.0 Filter

A simple Python script that filters and formats data to be fed to the [C5.0/See5 algorithm](https://www.rulequest.com/see5-info.html).

### Nice-to-haves:
- Passing files as inline arguments to the run command. For example:
	python filter.py shuttle.trn version-a.data
- Specifying how many attributes from the original data source to include in the filtered result.
